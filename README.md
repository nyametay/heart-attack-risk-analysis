# ❤️ Heart Attack Risk Level Prediction

This project uses data analysis and machine learning to predict the risk level of heart attacks based on medical attributes. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using classification techniques.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook walks through the steps to:

- Understand and clean heart health data
- Explore trends and correlations between variables
- Train classification models to predict heart attack risk levels
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning and feature transformation
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Train-test split and model evaluation
- Confusion matrix and accuracy scoring

## 🧰 Libraries & Tools

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
